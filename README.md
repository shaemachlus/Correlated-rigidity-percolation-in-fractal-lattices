# Fractal-correlation-RP

The code contained in this repository was used to generate the data presented in the paper "Correlated rigidty percolation in fractal lattices." 

To compile a program that runs the pebble game algorithm on a lattice of Sierpinski Gaskets, travel to the sg_lattice directory and execute 
g++ -std=c++17 connections.cpp coordinates.cpp main.cpp SiteRP.cpp bond.cpp 

To compile a program that runs the pebble game algorithm on a lattice of upwards pointing triangular plates, travel to triangular_plates and execute 
g++ -std=c++17 bond.cpp main.cpp SiteRP.cpp 

Understanding output:
Will add later.
