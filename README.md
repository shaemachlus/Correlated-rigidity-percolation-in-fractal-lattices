# Correlated-rigidity-percolation-in-fractal-lattices

The code contained in this repository was used to generate the data presented in the paper "Correlated rigidty percolation in fractal lattices."

Some of the code is currently unpolished in terms of comments. I will provide information on each file and make the comments more instructive later. Also, much of the code was not written by me. I will also try to make this more clear later.
